## DATA622 Project
- Assigned on November 22, 2017
- Due on December 17, 2017 11:59 PM EST
- 30 points possible, worth 30% of your final grade

### Instructions:
Read the online textbook [Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) in its entirety.  Use the code in the book to guide your steps to build an image recognition model on the classic MNIST dataset.  The data pull steps can also be found in the book.

### Critical Thinking (10 points)
Submit a 500 page explanation of the choices and tradeoffs you made in the process of building this model.  (e.g. why did you go X layers deep? why did you choose X cost function?).
>>> Please see writeupdocx.docx for a brief explanation of the choices made.
>>> For a detailed explanation, see https://github.com/cuny-sps-msda-data622-2017fall/project-msekhar12/blob/master/MNIST%20Project.ipynb

### Applied (20 points)
Submit all code, clean and commented.  Feel free to use any distributed computing methods we discussed in Unit 1 and Unit 2 to help you in this process, but it's not necessary.  
>>> See the file program.py

### Additional Resources

1. The [Goodfellow book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) on Deep Learning is the authorative resource on the subject.   
2. Check out [this curated list](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning) for even more resources on deep learning.
